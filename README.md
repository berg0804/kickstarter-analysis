# Kickstarting with Excel

## Ovierview of Project

### An analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends in funding successes and failures.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

####  To analyze the outcomes of theater Kickstarters based on month of the year, a pivot table looking at outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) by month of the year was created. From the data, a line chart was created looking at the outcomes over each month of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

####  To analyze outcomes based on goals, a pivot chart was created that compared outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) by the funding goal. The funding goals were divided in $5,000 increments. A line chart is used to track outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### There were not any challenges or difficulties in the anaylsis of the Kickstarter campagin data however there are limitiations to the analysis which are addressed below.

## Results

### In the analysis of outcomes based on launch date, the number of successful outcomes increased through May and declined throughout the rest of the year. Additionally, the amount of failed campaigns increased as the year progressed.

### In the analysis of outcomes based on goals, the analysis shows a relationship between the funding goal and the funding success rate. As the Kickstarter funding goal increased, the funding sucess rate increased.

### The analysis is limited to reviewing the funding goals and launch dates. Looking closer at the data could potentially better elucidate the effectiveness of Kickstarter campaigns. There also is not any context around the individual Kickstarter campaigns. For example, Kickstarter campaigns with better marketing or visibility may have better success rates.

### The analysis is limited to reviewing the funding goals and launch dates. There are numerous subset analyses that could be completed such as funding by category or country. Looking closer at the data could potentially better elucidate the effectiveness of Kickstarter campaigns. There also is not any context around the individual Kickstarter campaigns. For example, Kickstarter campaigns with better marketing or visibility may have better success rates.

### Additional graphs and charts could be added to the analysis, such as a bar graph displaying outcomes of each category and a bar graph displaying outcomes by country.
